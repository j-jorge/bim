</p>

Up to four players are stuck in a small arena with a single goal: be
the last person standing. The players can drop bombs to destroy the
walls or, ultimately, attack another player. Sometimes the broken
walls will expose a bonus such as extra bombs or an increase of the
bombs' blast distance.

The match features can be selected from the matchmaking screen. It is
enough of one player enabling a feature for all players benefiting
from it during the contest.
