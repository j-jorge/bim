    <h1>Bim! Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      Bim! is a game developed by Julien Jorge, but it does not
      matter. It is free software with no ad, no tracker, no trick for
      the end user.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not collect personal data but I do collect anonymous,
      non-identifying data. For example (non-exhaustive):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        the language in which your device is configured, so I know
        which translations I should work on,
      </li>
      <li>
        which buttons are clicked, so I know if something is useless
        in the user interface,
      </li>
      <li>
        which errors happen, so I know if there is an issue I should address.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These data are collected
      using <a href="https://posthog.com/">PostHog</a> and stored in
      Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that since this is an online game, I must also necessarily
      get your device's IP address. At the time of this writing this
      address is stored in a single place, in the logs of the web
      server when the game fetches the server list at launch time.
