    <h1>Bim! Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      Bim! is a game developed by Julien Jorge, but it does not
      matter. It is free software with no ad, no tracker, no trick for
      the end user. Except for the following paragraph, we do not
      process personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do store your device's IP address when the game fetches the
      server list at launch time. This IP is used to draw charts that
      will make me happy, seeing that people are playing this game.
