Bim! is an open-source multiplayer online mobile game of the last man standing genre.

Up to four players are stuck in a small arena with a single goal: be the last person standing. The players can drop bombs to destroy the walls or, ultimately, attack another player. Sometimes the broken walls will expose a bonus such as extra bombs or an increase of the bombs' blast distance.

The match's features can be selected from the matchmaking screen. It is enough of one player enabling a feature for all players benefiting from it during the contest.
