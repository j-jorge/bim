Still nobody around...

Let's say some jokes to kill time!

On a warm night, three vampires are discussing, recounting their life.

As the discussion progresses, some friendly competition happens.

"I'm the best vampire among us!" says the first vampire.

"Come on!", say the others, "then show us!"

"Hold my glass, I'll be back soon!"

Whoosh, the first vampire disappears and, whoosh, comes back immediately.

Blood is running out of her mouth, down her chin.

"Wow!" say the other vampires, "what happened?"

"See this house over there?" asks the first vampire.

"Yeah, yeah…"

"I drank the blood of every single person in this house."

"Incredible!" says the third vampire.

"That's nothing!" says the second vampire.

"Stay focused, I'll be back in two seconds."

Whoosh, the second vampire disappears and, whoosh, comes back one second later.

Blood is running out of his mouth, down his chin, his neck, and his chest.

"Aw! What happened?" say the others.

"See this building over there?" asks the second vampire.

"Wait! no way…" exult the other vampires in anticipation.

"Exactly! I drank the blood of every person in this building. Not a single drop remains!"

The first vampire is speechless while the third vampire sticks out his chest.

"This is child's play! Don't bat an eye, I'll show you how it's done."

Whoosh, the third vampire disappears and, whoosh, comes back at light speed.

Blood is running out of his mouth, down his chin, his neck, and his chest.

Hair, legs, arms, everything is covered in blood.

"Bloody night! What have you done?" Scream the other vampires awaiting for the much anticipated story.

"Well… do you see this tree over there?"

"Yeah! We do!". The other vampires could not be more excited.

"Well… I did not."

…

Ha! Ha!
